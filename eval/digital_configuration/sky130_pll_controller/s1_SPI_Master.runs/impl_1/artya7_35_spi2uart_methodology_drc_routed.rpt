The clock pin ETH_inst/II_MII_1/FD_TXD3/FD0/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#5 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin ETH_inst/II_MII_1/FD_TXEN/FD0/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#6 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin ETH_inst/II_MII_1/n898_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#7 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin ETH_inst/n1382/n561/CLK is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net eth_tx_clk_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): ETH_inst/MII_TX_CLK, eth_tx_clk_IBUF_inst/O
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell clk_1M_out_cnt_s[6]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) clk_1M_out_cnt_s_reg[0]/CLR, clk_1M_out_cnt_s_reg[1]/CLR,
clk_1M_out_cnt_s_reg[2]/CLR, clk_1M_out_cnt_s_reg[3]/CLR,
clk_1M_out_cnt_s_reg[4]/CLR, clk_1M_out_cnt_s_reg[5]/CLR,
clk_1M_out_cnt_s_reg[6]/CLR, clk_1M_out_s_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
